## V0.2 (current)
* Since the latest version of u-boot wouldn't work, an older version is used
  instead. Reasons for the latest u-boot not working are unknown.
* Enabled the building of a 2nd stage bootloader and name this `MLO` just as
  the Beagleboard C5 requires it to be.

## V0.1
Initial build, consists of a configuration for the U-boot bootloader and the
MLO that comes with it. Also includes an unconfigured and not looked at RFS.
